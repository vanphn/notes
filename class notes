// int: variable type used to define numeric variables holding whole numbers
        suited for storing integers
  
        - this converts an int to a string
        int a = 10;
        char *intStr = itoa(a);
        string str = string(intStr);
        
// const int: good for declaring "magic numbers or numbers that should be constant
              ex: HoursPerDay = 24;

// double: suited for storing numbers with fraction parts
        - double x = 0.5
        - when dividing, as long as one of the types is double
          then an int divided by a double will have double division
           
// unsigned int: useful data type for storing numbers that are not less than 0 
           
// bool: boolean, returns true or false statements
        --> cout << boolalpha 
        --> bool b;
            b = false;
            cout << b << endl;
            b = true;
            cout << b << endl;
            - this command makes printing booleans nicer
          
// char: stores a single variable 
        --> char x = 'a';
        
// math operations: remember to #include <cmath>
        --> remainder: %
            int c = 90;
            int d = 7;
            cout << c << " divided by " << d << " is " << c/d << " remainder " << c%d << endl;
        --> pow(2,14)
        --> sqrt(9)
        --> cos(0)
            
        --> setprecision(3) would set how many decimals places there would be
        
// cin
        --> cin.ignore() allows user to enter the next input by ignoring /n in the buffer
